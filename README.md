## Project Title

Contact-Us

## Description

This project is a Contact Us API built with Node.js and MySQL to handle form submissions, allowing users to submit contact details which are stored in a database. It supports full CRUD operations for managing contact submissions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/simranbeig-work/contact-us.git

2. Navigate into the project folder:
   cd contact-us

3. Install dependencies:
   npm i --save

4. Set up environment variables:
   Create a .env file based on .env-dev.
   Set up database credentials and configurations.
   Example:
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
   DB_NAME=ContactUsDBDev

5. Run the application:
   npm run start:dev _/for development environment_/

## API Endpoints

- `/contactus` (POST): Submit contact information
- `/contactus/:id` (GET): Fetch contact details by ID
- `/contactus/:id` (PUT): Fetch contact details by ID
- `/contactus/:id` (DELETE): Fetch contact details by ID

## Configuration

- The configuration files are located in the `config/` folder.
- You can modify the database connection in `config/db.js`.

## Database Set up

This project uses MySQL as the database. The database will be automatically created once the project is run.

1. Prerequisites

- Install MySQL.
- Ensure you have a MySQL user with sufficient privileges to create and manage databases and tables.
- Set up the following environment variables in your .env file:
  DB_HOST: MySQL host (e.g., localhost)
  DB_USER: MySQL username
  DB_PASSWORD: MySQL password
  DB_NAME: The name of the database (e.g., ContactUsDBDev)

2. Manually Run the DDL Scripts
   Before starting the server, you need to manually run the DDL scripts to create the necessary tables for the project.

   - Open MySQL Workbench or use the MySQL command line.

   - Run the following command to create the database (if not already created):
     CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS ContactUsDBDev;

   - Run all the DDL scripts located in the ddl folder to create the required tables:
     â€¢ Using the command line, you can run each .sql file manually:
     mysql -u <username> -p ContactUsDBDev < ddl/<filename>.sql

     Replace <filename> with the name of each DDL script in the ddl folder (e.g., contact-us.sql).

3. Run the Application:
   After setting up the environment and the database, run the application:
   npm run start:dev

The application will connect to the MySQL database and automatically create the necessary tables for storing contact submissions.

# Database Schema

The table ContactSubmissions will be created based on the DDL script located in ddl/contact-us.sql. This table stores user contact submissions, including full name, email, phone number, message, and submission date.
